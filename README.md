# Social_Analytics
In this exercise we analyze the sentiment of tweets from major news outlets using VADER analysis add-on for python. We pull the most recent 100 tweets for each outlet, run the analysis and then export the sentiments into a DataFrame. We then create visuals off of the DataFrame to illustrate the positive or negative tendencies of each outlet.
